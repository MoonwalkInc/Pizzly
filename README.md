# Pizzly

This is a fork of [Pizzly](https://github.com/Bearer/Pizzly) for a few reasons.

- ~Shopify required interactions to be within the browser and not a popup, so we made some tweaks~
- ~Shopify required our Moonwalk app to work as an embedded app in the Shopify admin view, and had to tweak some cookie security~
- the above were reverted and we now use a popup for consistency. There are some code changes from the main Pizzly but shouldn't be any major differences (mostly console.logs)
